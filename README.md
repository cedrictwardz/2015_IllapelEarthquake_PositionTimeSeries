# 2015_IllapelEarthquake_PositionTimeSeries

30-second position time series used to study the spatiotemporal evolution of the very-early afterslip following the 2015 Mw8.3 Illapel, Chile, earthquake. This dataset is used for a study whose results have been submitted to Geophys. Res. Lett. The raw data have been processed using the GIPSY-OASIS software developed at the JPL using the flowchart described in Twardzik et al. (2019), doi:10.1038/s41598-019-39038-z.
